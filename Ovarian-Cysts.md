# Ovarian Cysts

[Guinea Lynx: Ovarian Cysts](http://www.guinealynx.info/ovarian_cysts.html)

## Bianca

### Signs
- Slight hair loss on sides of her belly
- Elongated nipples with crystalline-looking crust
- Mounting cagemates

### Diagnosis
- Ultrasound revealed tiny bilateral ovarian cysts (one larger than the other)

### Treatment
- Spay

## Belle

### Signs
- Elongated nipples with crust (different from Bianca's--Belle's was more of a thin rock-like texture that built up quickly within a day)
- No hairloss
- No mounting

### Diagnosis
- Ultrasound revealed bilateral ovarian cysts

### Treatment
- Spay (showed that Belle's cysts were much more developed than Bianca's)

*Sidenote:* A few weeks after the surgery, Belle suddenly lost a lot of hair everywhere except for her head, to almost like it was thinning out. The hair grew back within a month to its original thickness and texture.

## Cookie

Btw, Cookie never had full-on ovarian cysts, but she was getting close to it.

### Signs
- Elongated nipples

### Treatment
- Switched from previous pellet brand (which had soy) to Sherwood. Nipples went back to normal

It's because of this (and the fact that Belle and Bianca had the same pellet brand and they also got ovarian cysts) is the reason I think soy causes reproductive problems for female guinea pigs.
