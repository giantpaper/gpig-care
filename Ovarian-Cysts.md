# Ovarian Cysts

[Guinea Lynx: Ovarian Cysts](http://www.guinealynx.info/ovarian_cysts.html)

## Bianca

### Signs
- Slight hair loss on sides of her belly
- Elongated nipples with crystalline-looking crust
- Mounting cagemates

### Diagnosis
- Ultrasound revealed tiny bilateral ovarian cysts (one larger than the other)

### Treatment
- Spay

## Belle

### Signs
- Elongated nipples with crust (different from Bianca's--Belle's was more of a thin rock-like texture that built up quickly within a day)
- No hairloss
- No mounting

### Diagnosis
- Ultrasound revealed bilateral ovarian cysts

### Treatment
- Spay (showed that Belle's cysts were much more developed than Bianca's)

*Sidenote:* A few weeks after the surgery, Belle suddenly lost a lot of hair everywhere except for her head, to almost like it was thinning out. The hair grew back within a month to its original thickness and texture.
