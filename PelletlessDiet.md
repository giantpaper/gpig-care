# Pelletless Diet

(Made with stone pigs in mind.)

## Water

- Filtered water in water bottles
- Wet down greens

## Calcium

(You still want calcium, but you want it to be absorbed better by the body.)

[For humans, but also might work for guinea pigs](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/bc2u20/here_are_a_few_things_that_have_calcium_in_them/)
> "Don't rely on spinach. It may have a high calcium content, but the bioavailability is close to zero due to oxalates. Broccoli also has oxalates and a reduced calcium bioavailability, but less severe."

(This is advice for a human looking to avoid a kidney stone, not sure how relevant it is for guinea pigs.)
> "Drink plenty of water, and consider reducing your sodium intake. Sodium raises the calcium content of urine." [src][6]

(FYI, pellets are pretty freaking salty. A lot more salty than most human food.)

### Oxalates

Oxalates decreases calcium absorption. So pick veggies with higher calcium and lower oxalates. [src][1]

### Vitamin D

#### Sources

##### Supplementation

(Unsure of max level to give.)

##### UV Lights

##### Sunlight Exposure

> "Just to be clear, the range of UV light necessary to stimulate the production of Vit D in the skin DOES NOT pass through window glass. So, it doesn't matter whether a room is bright or dark if there's glass in the window." [src][2]

> "If you are aiming at vitamin D via the sun, direct sunlight is best. I would sit with your pig in the sun so you ensure your guinea pig does not overheat." [src][5]

### Hypervitaminosis D

> "I'd just urge caution. D is a fat-soluble vitamin and stored in the body. I'd be reaaalllll worried about an eventual toxic buildup if the supplemented amount was more than truly miniscule." [src][3] [src][4]

Can be deadly.
