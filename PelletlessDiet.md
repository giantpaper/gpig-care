# Pelletless Diet

## Calcium

(You still want calcium, but you want it to be absorbed better by the body.)

[For humans, but also might work for guinea pigs](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/bc2u20/here_are_a_few_things_that_have_calcium_in_them/)
> "Don't rely on spinach. It may have a high calcium content, but the bioavailability is close to zero due to oxalates. Broccoli also has oxalates and a reduced calcium bioavailability, but less severe."

### Oxalates

Oxalates decreases calcium absorption. So pick veggies with higher calcium and lower oxalates. [1]

### Vitamin D

#### Sources

##### Supplementation



##### UV Lights

##### Sunlight Exposure

> "Just to be clear, the range of UV light necessary to stimulate the production of Vit D in the skin DOES NOT pass through window glass. So, it doesn't matter whether a room is bright or dark if there's glass in the window." [2]

### Hypervitaminosis D
(No idea what the max level of Vit D is for a guinea pig right now.)

> "I'd just urge caution. D is a fat-soluble vitamin and stored in the body. I'd be reaaalllll worried about an eventual toxic buildup if the supplemented amount was more than truly miniscule." [3][4]

Can be deadly.
